# Addamsovkas-revit-addin

This is my first Revit addin using WPF UI framework.

There will be few button commands. Main command Xem(eXport 'em) will create UI for remembering view sets to export with preset naming rules according to user.
This should help to export model variants from one Revit file in one step. My primal goal is to learn the WPF and C# while transfering from Python scripts in Revit.
