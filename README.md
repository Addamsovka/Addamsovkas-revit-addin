# Addamsovkas-revit-addin

This is my first Revit addin using WPF UI framework.

There will be a few button commands. Main command Xem(eXport 'em) will create a UI for remembering view sets to export with preset naming rules according to the user.
This should help to export model variants from one Revit file in one step. My primal goal is to learn the WPF and C# via this plugin. The secondary goal is to understand Revit plugins better.
